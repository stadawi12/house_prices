In this directory we have three stages of the data.

raw data, provided by kaggle.

clean data, this is data that has been transformed, all the string
values in the data have been transformed into integers and all nan
values have been set to "NaN" or 0, this is the clean data but has not
been processed, i.e. we keep all the columns of this data.

train data, this is data that is ready for training, processed data
where certain columns of the data have been removed because their
correlation with the house_price was low.
